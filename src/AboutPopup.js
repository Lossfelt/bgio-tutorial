        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          After the neo-Amish induced crypto-collapse of '47, USA ceased to exist as a nation.
          Following the discovery in '73 of vast reserves of Rareium, the fallen nation again had the world's attention, however this time as a resource.
          The now powerful Mexican queendom and the Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance are both greedily claiming territory. Clashes are unavoidable.
        </p>
        <h2>The Mexican Queendom</h2>
        <img style={{ width: '50%' }} src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/Mexican_Queendom.jpg'} alt="Mexican Queendom flag" />
        <img style={{ width: '20%' }} src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/Queendom_icon.png'} alt="Mexican Queendom icon" />
        <p>
          The Mexican Queendom is a matriarchal society where the queen is both the head of state, the head of the church and the head of the cartels.
          It's a totalitarian regime where the queen's word is law, controlling every level of society.
          Information is tightly controlled and dissent is not tolerated. The Mexican Queendom is a mix of traditional Mexican culture combined with a glorified roman empire.
          Their land based military is second to none.
        </p>
        <h2>The Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance</h2>
        <img style={{ width: '50%' }} src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/Pan-Canadia.jpg'} alt="Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance flag" />
        <img style={{ width: '20%' }} src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/Pan-Canadia_icon.png'} alt="Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance icon" />
        <p>
          The Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance is a confederation of Inuit tribes that originally banded together to protect their lands.
          The Alliance has through deft political manouvering and cunning trade deals managed to become a major player on the world stage.
          On the surface it's a democracy, but in reality the Inuit-led businesses and corporations control the government.
          The Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance is a mix of traditional Inuit culture combined with a modern capitalist society.
          Their navy is the strongest in the world.

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
          In this game, you will play as either the Mexican Queendom or the Pan-Canadia Inuit Alliance.
          Your goal is to be the first to have four of your faction's flag in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like regular Tic Tac Toe, play proceeds turn-based, each player able to claim a square on the board.
          Unlike Tic Tac Toe, however, players may try to claim the oppononts squares (with low probability of success).
          Also, each controlled square has a small chance each round of rebelling, causing the controlling player to loose that square.
          Additionally, each square controlled gives the player 1 unit of the resource Rareium per round. Rareium, in turn, has a chance to unlock the use of strategic weapons.
        </p>
        <p>The available strategic weapons are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Artillery: destroys target square and the four orthogonal neighbours</li>
          <li>Air Strike: destroys three target squares in a line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal, must be next to each other)</li>
          <li>Biological Warfare: each square in a three by three area around the target has a 50% chance to be destroyed</li>
        </ul>
